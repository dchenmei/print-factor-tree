# Print-Factor-Tree

**print-factor-tree** is a binary tree like implementation that prints a factor tree. A **factor tree** is a binary tree where the leafs are factors of the root. It is often used to teach prime factorization or math wizardry in math circles. 

## Usage 

With provided executable:

```sh
cd print-factor-tree
./print-factor-tree
```

Compile it yourself:

```sh
cd print-factor-tree
g++ print_factor_tree.cpp factor_tree.cpp factor.cpp -std=c++11 -o print_factor_tree
```

## Contribute

Currently, print-factor-tree prints an unformatted tree. I also tested the files when writing them but did not do a full on unit test. If anyone is interested in working in either area, hit me up!
